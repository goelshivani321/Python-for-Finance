## Stock Price Calculator

### Part 1  
The goal is to use python to implement a stock price calculator.
The program takes the following inputs:
* A stock symbol
* Allotment (number of shares)
* Final share price (in dollars)
* Sell commission (in dollars)
* Inital share price (in dollars)
* Buy commission (in dollars)
* Captial gain tax rate (in %)

The program outputs the following after computation:
* Proceeds (Allotment x Final share price)
* Cost (Allotment x Initial Share Price + commissions + Tax on Capital Gain)
* Net Profit (in dollars)
* Return on investment (in %)
* Break even price (in dollars)

### Part 2
The goal of this lab is to practice the usage of Python with networking programming. Perform the following:

I am using Alpha Vantage as the python API to retrieve financial data. 
This service returns the latest price and volume information for a security of our choice.
The Python program will take a stock symbol as input and output the following:
* Current date and time
* Full name of the company
* Stock price
* Value changes (+ for increase and - for decrease)
* Percentage changes (+ for increase and - for decrease)

The program also handles any error situation (such as no network, invalid symbol, etc.)
The python code showcases usage of dictionaries and functions in python.

To quit the calculator just type 'quit'
