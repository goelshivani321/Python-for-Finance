## Stock Price Calculator

### Part 1  
The goal is to use python to implement a stock price calculator.
The program takes the following inputs:
* A stock symbol
* Allotment (number of shares)
* Final share price (in dollars)
* Sell commission (in dollars)
* Inital share price (in dollars)
* Buy commission (in dollars)
* Captial gain tax rate (in %)

The program outputs the following after computation:
* Proceeds (Allotment x Final share price)
* Cost (Allotment x Initial Share Price + commissions + Tax on Capital Gain)
* Net Profit (in dollars)
* Return on investment (in %)
* Break even price (in dollars)
